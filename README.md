Simulation templates for droplet transport
+ Folder `PSPM` contains the solver using pseudo-single-phase model (PSPM) developed based on OpenFOAM v2106, more details can be found in the README.md in that folder
+ Folder `QMOM` contains the solver using quadrature based moment method developed based on OpenFOAM v2106 and OpenQBMM v7, more details can be found in the README.md in that folder
+ Folder `SM` contains the solver using sectional method developed based on OpenFOAM v8, more details can be found in the README.md in that folder
+ Folder `testing_cases` contains the testing cases of the above mentioned solvers

The above codes and testing cases are for the journal article "A computational fluid dynamicsâ€”Population balance equation approach for evaporating cough droplets transport" submitted to "International Journal of Multiphase Flow", whose DOI is [10.1016/j.ijmultiphaseflow.2023.104500](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmultiphaseflow.2023.104500).
